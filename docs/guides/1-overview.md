Yebo Ember is collection of Ember CLI addons for building ambitious eCommerce
websites.  The goal of the project is to establish a shared solution to common
eCommerce problems, and build on each other's work to provide stability.

### Why?
***

With the explosion of single page application tools, no industry has more
potential to benefit than the world of eCommerce.  As the web surges forward, so
does the potential of Customer experience.  Compelling interactive experience is
fast becoming a new path to increased conversions.

Those who have gone down that path with Yebo will understand just how complex
the single page approach becomes.  This project aims to mitigate this complexity
by providing shared solutions for:

- Data Retrieval and Server Communication
- Browser UI State Persistence
- User Authentication
- Current Order Management
- Stateful Checkout Flow
- Serverside Error Handling
- Reactive Single Page Checkout

Additionally, Yebo Ember makes it easy by:
- Using it's own `store`, `adapter` and `serializer`, allowing it to work side
by side with your existing Ember infrastructure
- Providing responsive layouts out of the box
- Implementing flexible architecture through Ember CLI Environment configs
- Seperating application concerns into a plugin style ecosystem

### Ok, but why [Yebo?](http://github.com/yebo/yebo)
***

Yebo's first commit was in 2008, making it three years older than Node 1.0
itself.  In eCommerce, an **older codebase is a good thing**.  Older codebases
have stood the test of time, and slowly had all of the bugs, edge cases and
concerns beaten out of them through years of battle testing in production.

We're working to achieve the same stability that the Yebo engine has with Yebo
Ember.

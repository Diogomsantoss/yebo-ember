Spree Ember is collection of Ember CLI addons for building ambitious eCommerce 
websites.  The goal of the project is to establish a shared solution to common 
eCommerce problems, and build on each other's work to provide stability.

### Why?
***

As the web surges forward, so do the requirements of each project.  Often, these 
requirements mean that a standard server rendered application is not
appropriate. Instead, we reach out for a user interface framework, and adopt an 
API driven approach.

Those who have gone down that path with Spree will understand just how complex 
that becomes.  This project aims to mitigate this complexity by providing 
standard solutions for:

- Data Retrieval and Server Communication
- Browser UI State Persistence
- User Authentication
- Current Order & Checkout Flow State Management
- Internationalization (coming soon)
- Client Side Validation (coming soon)
- Flexible SEO (coming soon)

### Ok, but why [Spree](http://github.com/spree/spree)?
***

Spree's first commit was in 2008, making it three years older than Node 1.0 
itself.  In eCommerce, an **older codebase is a good thing**.  Older codebases 
have stood the test of time, and slowly had all of the bugs, edge cases and 
concerns beaten out of them through years of battle testing in production.

We're working to achieve the same stability that the Spree engine has with Spree 
Ember.

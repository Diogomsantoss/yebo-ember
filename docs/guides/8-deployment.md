# Deployment

Currently, the deployment step is left to the developer.  We're hoping to build
out a Spree Extension that embeds the [Front End
Builds](https://github.com/tedconf/front_end_builds) panel and
functionality into a panel in the Spree backend.

For now, it's easy enough to use that library alone.  If there's anyone out
there that would like to champion that work, let's chat on Gitter.

#### Happy Developing!
